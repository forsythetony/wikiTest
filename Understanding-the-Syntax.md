## Code Formatting  
Code formatting is used to denote "system" language, instructions that can be interpreted by a computer (e.g. code, keystrokes, terminal/cmd commands, etc).

#### Purpose  
* Explicit system commands  
   * "Now run the command `ipconfig`"
* Keystrokes
   * "During system boot hold down `F11` to change boot device"
* File names
   * "Double click `KinectSetup.bat`"
* Directory names
   * "Navigate to `/var/www/`"
* Specific menu options
   * "In the menu select `Use Default Keymap`"
* General code
   * "Append the following code to the file `#include "importantHeader.h"`"

#### What it is not used for
* Non-explicit instructions or commands
   * "Now select `the only folder`"
* General emphasis
   * "When rebooting `DO NOT` unplug the power cable"

## Italicizing
Italics in this wiki are used for much the same purpose as they are out in the rest of the world.

#### Purpose
* Clarification
   * " Now start clonezilla  
   *Clonezilla is software that handles the creation and use of device images* "
* Making a note of something
   * " Open the disc tray  
   *If it does not open the first time do not try to pry it open* "
